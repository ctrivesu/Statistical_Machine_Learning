Q5_Dataset_Processing 

1. It will generate the pertinent graphs upon running and close the graph upon exit


Q6_Naive_Bayes_Implementation

1. Update the mypath= " " as per the path where the dataset is stored.
2. Upon running the code it will generate the following files:
	x_elem_positive	-> List of all the words in the positive class training set
	x_set_positive	-> (Word_No, File_No, Frequency) for positive class training set

	x_elem_negative	-> List of all the words in the negative class training set
	x_set_negative 	-> (Word_No, File_No, Frequency) for negative class training set

3. In the output it would print '%_of_dataset_used_for_training    Accuracy_Achieved'
