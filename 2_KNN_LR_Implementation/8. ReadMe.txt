1. LR_Code_Accuracy_each_step

	1. This needs the dataset to be in the same folder as the python file to execute
	2. It would generate Weight_xx files for each iteration and print out the prediction accuracy at each step
	3. Please refer the Report for the expected prediction curve

4.LR_Code_Final_Accuracy_only
	1. Update the file paths in this code by searching for "open" string throughout the file.
	2. This would give the final accuracy of the LR model after 100 iteration

5. KNN_Final
	1. Update the file paths in this code by searching for "open" string throughout the file.
	2. This would give predicition accuracy vs no of nearest neighbours taken into classification account.
